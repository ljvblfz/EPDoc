# Introduction

This guide outlines the steps to setup Elastic Path source code so a development team or a single person creating a proof of concept can start construction.

## Team Infrastructure Setup

The Team Infrastructure Setup section describes how to create an environment for your entire development team to work together on the same code base.

Elastic Path Commerce team environments are tested with the following technologies:

* Git - source control
* Nexus - Maven repository
* Jenkins - Continuous integration

If you decide to use alternate technologies, you may run into unexpected problems, and it may be more difficult to get your environment working.

## POC Infrastructure Setup

POC (proof of concept) Infrastructure Setup section describes how to quickly set up an individual developer environment so you can begin constructing an Elastic Path proof of concept project without needing the team infrastructure.
