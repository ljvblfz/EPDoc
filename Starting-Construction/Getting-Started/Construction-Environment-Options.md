# Consider Environment Options

There are various environment options available when engaging with Elastic Path. Each option is designed to fit a purpose or audience and as a result the completeness of each environment is adjusted accordingly. Options are ordered in the table as a progression from left to right with completeness building as you progress in this direction. Generally, as you move through the enablement process you will progress through these environment options in this order, likely with some overlap.

> **Warning: EP Demo Accessibility**
> EP Demo packages are only available to EP Partners. If you are not an EP Partner, please contact your EP Sales Representative to discuss.
